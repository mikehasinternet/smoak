My first attempt at writing a text adventure using Python

You can travel "north" (n), "south" (s), "east" (e), or "west" (w). You can also "look" (l) to repeat the description of the area.
You can attempt to "take" items to add them to your inventory or "investigate" items for more information.
You can see the items you have on hand with "inventory" (i) and can "use" items to perform an action.
Quit the game with "quit" (q). Type "help" (?) to show this message again.
